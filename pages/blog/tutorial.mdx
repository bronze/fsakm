## What is Nextra?

Nextra is a Next.js-based static site generator that's perfect for creating documentation sites. It provides a simple and flexible way to manage content with markdown files and supports features like syntax highlighting, custom themes, and more.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without writing CSS from scratch. Its component-based approach and extensive customization options make it a popular choice for modern web development.

## Introduction to shadcn

shadcn is a simple and customizable component library that pairs well with Tailwind CSS. It provides a set of pre-designed components that you can easily integrate into your project, helping you maintain consistency and speed up development.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start with a Nextra Project

Following the official Nextra documentation, create a new Nextra project:

import {Card, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle} from "@/components/ui/card";

<Card className="inline-block">
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Nextra Project Setup Tutorial</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardFooter className="gap-2">
    <Button variant="outline" asChild>
      <Link href="https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/start" className="gap-2">
        Follow Nextra Docs
      </Link>
    </Button>
    <Button asChild>
      <Link
        href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fnextra-docs-template&showOptionalTeamCreation=false"
        className="gap-2">
        Deploy Nextra on Vercel
      </Link>
    </Button>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>

### Step 3: Install Tailwind CSS

Follow the Tailwind CSS installation steps:

1. Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   ```

2. Create your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`:

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

3. Configure your template paths in `tailwind.config.js`:

   ```js
   // tailwind.config.js
   module.exports = {
     content: ["theme.config.js", "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}", "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   ```

4. Include Tailwind in your CSS:

   ```css
   /* styles/globals.css */
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

### Step 4: Setup shadcn Components

Setup baseUrl in for tsconfig.json:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Init shadcn:

```bash
npx shadcn init
```

Install shadcn components, for example, button:

```bash
npx shadcn add button
```

You can now import and use shadcn components in your pages or components. For example:

```jsx
import {Button} from "@/components/ui/button";
<Button>Shadcn Button</Button>;
```

## Conclusion
